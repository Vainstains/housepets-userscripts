# housepets-userscripts
a few userscripts i made with deepseek to help with housepets stuff

this uses an amalgamation of scraped stuff from the wayback machine, the old site, and the new site

## `character-and-arcs.js`
adds character lists and arc labels underneath the panels on the https://rickgriffinstudios.com/housepets site.
## `link-migrator.js`
Attemps to migrate urls from https://www.housepetscomic.com/ to https://rickgriffinstudios.com/housepets.
It is not perfect, some things will not work properly because my scrape had some holes, but it catches a lot of stuff.
